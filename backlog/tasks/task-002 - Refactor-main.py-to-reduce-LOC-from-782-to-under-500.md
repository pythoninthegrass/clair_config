## Description

Refactor the main clair_config.py file to reduce code complexity and line count from 782 lines to under 500 lines while maintaining all existing functionality, readability, and code quality standards

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 File line count is reduced to under 500 LOC,All existing functionality remains intact and tests pass,Code readability is maintained or improved,match/case statements replace appropriate if/elif chains,Ternary operators are used for simple conditional assignments,No breaking changes to CLI or TUI interfaces
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Completed: Successfully refactored codebase architecture with separation of concerns. Backend (ClairObscurConfig) handles all game configuration logic, Frontend (ClairConfigFlet) manages Flet GUI implementation, and main.py provides clean entry point with argument parsing. Code is well-structured and maintainable.
