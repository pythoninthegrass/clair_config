## Description

Split the monolithic main.py file into separate frontend and backend components to improve separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. The backend will handle configuration management logic while the frontend handles UI components, with main.py serving as a thin orchestration layer.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Backend module contains ClairObscurConfig class and all configuration logic
- [ ] #2 Frontend module contains ClairConfigTUI class and all UI-related classes (ConfigOption, GameVersionSection, GraphicsSection, PresetSection, AdvancedSection)
- [ ] #3 main.py becomes a thin orchestration layer coordinating frontend and backend
- [ ] #4 All existing functionality is preserved after refactoring
- [ ] #5 Configuration management and UI are completely decoupled
- [ ] #6 Backend can be used independently without UI components
<!-- AC:END -->
